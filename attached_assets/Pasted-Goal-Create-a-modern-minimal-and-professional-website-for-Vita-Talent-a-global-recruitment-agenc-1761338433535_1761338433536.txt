Goal:
Create a modern, minimal, and professional website for Vita Talent, a global recruitment agency that connects businesses with exceptional talent from around the world.

Brand Identity

Name: Vita Talent

Logo: A tree symbol (represents growth, trust, and integrity).

Slogan: “Where integrity meets opportunity.”

Accent line: “Empowering businesses with exceptional global talent.”

Primary color: Dark green (deep, elegant tone).

Style keywords: Clean · Minimal · Global · Professional · Elegant · Trustworthy

Tone: Empathetic, confident, and human — focused on long-term partnerships.

Website Structure
1. Hero Section

Prominent Vita Talent logo + slogan.

Subheading: “Empowering businesses worldwide with the right people, wherever they are.”

Include placeholder logos for companies that trust Vita Talent (to be replaced later).

Two buttons:

Hire Talent

Join as Candidate

2. Why Global Section

Elegant section explaining the global approach:

“Why limit yourself to one continent when the world is full of extraordinary talent?
Vita Talent brings together skilled professionals from Africa, Latin America, Asia, and beyond — giving businesses the freedom to hire the best, no matter where they are.”

Add a soft animated world map or subtle continent highlights to visualize the concept.

3. Workflow / Process Section

Visually explain Vita Talent’s process from A → Z in 5 clean, illustrated steps:

Understanding client needs

Sourcing top candidates globally

Screening and vetting

Matching and onboarding

Ongoing support for both sides

Include icons and a short sentence per step.

Design it more engaging and fitting to Vita Talent’s brand (not identical to Virtual Latinos, but inspired by its clarity).

4. Testimonials Section

Inspired by HireLatam: simple, central, and powerful.

Include:

3 client video testimonials

3 candidate video testimonials

3 written client testimonials

3 written candidate testimonials

Layout example:

Video testimonials in top rows (carousel or 2x3 grid).

Written testimonials below with names, roles, and short blurbs.

Below testimonials:
“Read more on Google Reviews
 or Trustpilot
” — make these real hyperlinks.

5. Care Section

Title: “We care about people — and partnerships.”

Subtext:
“At Vita Talent, we believe great hiring is about balance.
We care equally for our clients’ business success and our candidates’ wellbeing.
Even if a match doesn’t work out, we continue to support both sides.”

Include an illustration or friendly image (team, handshake, or balanced scale).

6. Meet the Team

Grid of team member cards with photo, name, and short role description.

Clean and consistent layout similar to Virtual Latinos.

7. Call to Action

Simple contact area at the bottom with two CTAs:

Hire Talent → opens inquiry form.

Join as Candidate → opens candidate application form.

Optional footer links: Home · About · Process · Testimonials · Contact

Keep page short and scrollable — avoid unnecessary long sections or flashy animations.

Technical Requirements

Fully responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Use semantic HTML5, CSS (or Tailwind), and modern layout principles.

Support easy content editing for testimonials, text, and company logos.

Optimized for fast loading (no heavy animations).

Include smooth scroll transitions and subtle hover effects.

Design Notes

Don’t make the page long or overloaded — prioritize clarity and user engagement.

Use subtle graphics similar to HireLatam for visual appeal.

Keep fonts simple and professional (e.g., Inter, Lato, or Open Sans).

Include hyperlink icons for Google Reviews and Trustpilot at the end of testimonials.

Ensure color contrast is accessible and consistent with the dark green theme.

✅ Summary of Key Inspirations:

HireLatam: simplicity, client/candidate testimonials in the middle of the page (video + text).

Virtual Latinos: structure, green theme, process explanation, and team layout — but improved and more elegant.
